# Betting Against All Betas

Frazzini and Pedersen’s (2013) Betting Against Beta is an investment strategy that exploits
a well-documented anomaly in the Capital Asset Pricing Model. This anomaly is called the beta
anomaly, which states that the model overestimates the risk-adjusted returns of high beta assets
and underestimates the risk-adjusted returns of low beta assets. According to the beta anomaly,
betas and alphas should be negatively correlated. Frazzini and Pedersen prove that an investor is
able to generate positive abnormal returns by holding a long position in low beta assets and a short
position in high beta assets. They also show that their Betting Against Beta factor delivers
statistically significant returns when adjusted for multiple factors. My research seeks to test the
significance of the beta anomaly in the market factor when adjusted for factors used in the Fama-
French 5-Factor model that controls for the known size, value, momentum, profitability, and
investment factors. I find that the beta anomaly loses significance in the market factor when
adjusted for the Fama-French 5-Factor model, proving that Frazzini and Pedersen’s results are not
robust. I also test for a factor beta anomaly across the size, value, momentum, profitability, and
investment factors, as well as the significance of style beta anomalies when adjusted for additional
factors. I find that the HML, RMW, and CMA factors show statistically strong patterns that can
be made into effective investment strategies.
